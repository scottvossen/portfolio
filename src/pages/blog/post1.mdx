This post details authorization scenarios primarily for service to service authentication using Managed Identities in Azure.

## Application Roles

- Defined by each project's [manifest.json](../architecture/project-manifest) file.
- DEV-CLI provisioning is executed during deployments to apply changes to role definitions and assignments
- Roles must be named with a prefix matching the project's `ServiceId` (`{Scs}-{Name}`)
- Roles can be assigned to any valid `ServiceId`

## S2S Auth

Daemon Dev Platform app authentication for calls to other Dev Platform APIs.

This is handled via `manifest.json` configuration specifying custom App Roles to be defined on the `*-cor-platform` AAD App and assigned to managed system identities for authorized applications.

Due to [24 hour identity token caching](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/managed-identity-best-practice-recommendations#limitation-of-using-managed-identities-for-authorization), **special care must be taken when modifying app role definitions**. [See this guide for details](../architecture/project-manifest#modifying-approles).
